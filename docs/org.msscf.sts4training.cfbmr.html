<H2>Mark Stephen Sobkow's Training for Spring Tool Suite 4: org.msscf.sts4training.cfbmr</H2>
<p>
The Code Forge Business Model Repository will be a persistent store in the long run, but
for the purposes of this training prototype, I'll just be using an H2 instance for storage.
I won't use a full PostgreSQL instance until later in the training/prototyping life cycles.
<p>
I have most of a top level object, the Model Repository table itself.  A given repository
can hold any number of logical repositories, likely one per project a client is managing
with MssCFe.
<p>
The mapping for the Top Level Domain object is trivial, and doesn't require planning.
<p>
The next object triple is a little hairier - I need a Domain object as a base class that
can own a Project, User, host a Service, or do any number of things.  The subclass
TopDomain is a subclass of Domain and has a Top Level Domain as its parent, and contain
SubDomains or the usual domain resources.  A SubDomain contains the usual Domain resources
or other SubDomains in hierarchical fashion.  I had not enabled full hierarchy definitions
in MSS Code Factory because I wanted to be compatible with DB/2 LUW, but I'm no longer
willing to limit my application to satisfy one vendor, who is becoming ever more and more
irrelevant to my market share as a consultant.
<p>
A Project has some interesting changes since MSS Code Factory.  It is going to be a
"root" entry for a cluster of ProjectBranch instances that add a Branch attribute to the
key value.  So you can have any number of logical branches of a specific project.
<p>
Each ProjectBranch has a BranchName, a MajorVersion number, a MinorVersion number,
a BuildNumber (6 digits), and a BuildTag.  These form a formatted string of
<tt>"=MajorVersion_MinorVersion-Build[-BuildTag]"</tt> when versioned file names
are required, such as the names of .zip files, installer executables, Debian packages,
and so forth.
<p>
There is always a "main" Branch, the same as for Git.  I'm debating adding git hooks
to the projects so that I can tie in git automatically on the client nodes.  I want
the code manufacturing, build, and checkin processes to be as automated as possible.
All I think I'd really need to do is add a GitRepository attribute to a Project, which
would be used to do initial clones and pushes of projects.
<p>
The Project contains SchemaDef instances, which contain optional SchemaRef
specifications that reference other schemas by fully qualified
Tld.TopDomain{.SubDomain}.Project.Schema format, with an optional Branch name
defaulting to "main" if no branch is specified, and an optional Release name
as well (I realized while writing that I need to identify the releases of a branch
for reference, not just the branch itself, so that you can reference historical
releases for the sake of compatibility with newer projects.)
<P>
Note that I haven't decided how I'll deal with creating branches, merging branches,
deleting branches, or doing tagged releases of a branch.  I also need to add another
sub-object level for a ProjectBranchRelease object as well, which would be a full
copy of the ProjectBranch in question at the time the Release is created.  So you'd
work with Branches, but create Releases for the branch, and you'll need to reference
an optional Release name as well as the Branch name for your SchemaRefs.
<p>
I don't intend to do commit tracking at all.  Every change you make is committed
automatically; the concept of a GIT commit type behaviour outside the meaning of
"make my current edits persistent" is anathema to a database guy.
<p>
That is as far as I'll go with the training prototype.  The rest of my modelling
information is internal and private for now.  Enjoy this sneak peak at a piece
of MssCFe.
