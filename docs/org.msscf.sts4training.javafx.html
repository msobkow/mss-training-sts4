<H2>Mark Stephen Sobkow's Training for Spring Tool Suite 4: org.msscf.sts4training.javafx</H2>
<p>
This challenging-to-write prototype integrates JavaFX 14 with OpenJDK 14 and Spring Boot
using the code provided by Mario Jauvin as the starting point.  Mario's code was based on
JavaFX 11, OpenJDK 11, and an earlier release of Spring, though, so a lot of changes and
tweaks had to be coded and tested before I was satisfied that I have the two layers talking
together properly.
<p>
Unlike Mario's example, mine provides some simple widgets and demonstrates maintaining and
integrating an application model with those widgets, rather than just doing the essential
basic lifting of getting JavaFX to display a GUI that doesn't have any back-end data to
manipulate.
<p>
There will be later examples that build on this particular code base as I flesh out the
architectural layer prototypes I need for MssCFe over time and as I find them overlapping
with client's technology needs.
<p>
This functionality is an essential requirement for any JavaFX GUI clients that wish to
leverage the Spring Boot infrastructure and service components.
