<H2>Welcome to Mark Stephen Sobkow's Training for Spring Tool Suite 4 (mss-training-sts4)!</H2>
<p>
All of Mark Stephen Sobkow's Open and Shared Source projects have their
web presence hosted under <A Target="_blank" HREf="https://msscf.org/">https://msscf.org/</A> 
subdomains, with one subdomain per project.  All of the git repositories for
same are hosted at <A Target="_blank" HRef="https://github.com/msobkow">https://github.com/msobkow</A>
at this time, though as I move forward with incorporation, I will set up a corporate
git account and transfer ownership of the Training for Spring Tool Suite 4 to that corporate
entity.
<p>
This project comprises a family of implemented and planned architectural prototypes to flesh
out the implementation details of the various layers I need for my plans for the MssCFe
application I have in mind for future development.  Most of the architectural layers I'll need
are common to many Spring Boot applications, and I'm already finding a few of my planned
prototypes getting bumped up the priority list to deal with client's needs that are more
pressing than my own.
<p>
The main project pom for this family of prototypes contains a number of sub-module
prototypes.  Each sub-project package deals with a new architecural layer that needs
to be prototyped so I know how to tie the pieces together in real world applications.
<p>
Note that the intent of this project is NOT to provide training to other internet users,
but to serve as a playground for my own integration training efforts.  I just thought that
as I work through the details, others might find my up-to-date samples of approaches others
have taken in the past to be useful refreshers for those original code samples and training
guides.  I certainly don't take credit for the bulk of the algorithms and approaches in my
prototypes - they all leverage example code and documentation and help tips from the
internet at large.  When I run across a new source, I try to comment on the URL in the code,
but that is as far as any credits to original thought go.
<p>
<H3>org.msscf.sts4training.config</H3>
<p>
This rather simple prototype deals with integrating Spring Boot applications with configuration
property files that can be overridden at the command line in the usual Java CLI fashion.
<p>
<H3>org.msscf.sts4training.javafx</H3>
<p>
This challenging-to-write prototype integrates JavaFX 14 with OpenJDK 14 and Spring Boot
using the code provided by Mario Jauvin as the starting point.  Mario's code was based on
JavaFX 11, OpenJDK 11, and an earlier release of Spring, though, so a lot of changes and
tweaks had to be coded and tested before I was satisfied that I have the two layers talking
together properly.
<p>
Unlike Mario's example, mine provides some simple widgets and demonstrates maintaining and
integrating an application model with those widgets, rather than just doing the essential
basic lifting of getting JavaFX to display a GUI that doesn't have any back-end data to
manipulate.
<p>
There will be later examples that build on this particular code base as I flesh out the
architectural layer prototypes I need for MssCFe over time and as I find them overlapping
with client's technology needs.
