<H2>Welcome to Mark Stephen Sobkow's Training for Spring Tool Suite 4 (mss-training-sts4)!</H2>
<p>
All of Mark Stephen Sobkow's Open and Shared Source projects have their
web presence hosted under <A Target="_blank" HREf="https://msscf.org/">https://msscf.org/</A> 
subdomains, with one subdomain per project.  All of the git repositories for
same are hosted at <A Target="_blank" HRef="https://github.com/msobkow">https://github.com/msobkow</A>
at this time, though as I move forward with incorporation, I will set up a corporate
git account and transfer ownership of the Training for Spring Tool Suite 4 to that corporate
entity.
<p>
This project comprises a family of implemented and planned architectural prototypes to flesh
out the implementation details of the various layers I need for my plans for the MssCFe
application I have in mind for future development.  Most of the architectural layers I'll need
are common to many Spring Boot applications, and I'm already finding a few of my planned
prototypes getting bumped up the priority list to deal with client's needs that are more
pressing than my own.
<p>
The main project pom for this family of prototypes contains a number of sub-module
prototypes.  Each sub-project package deals with a new architecural layer that needs
to be prototyped so I know how to tie the pieces together in real world applications.
<p>
Note that the intent of this project is NOT to provide training to other internet users,
but to serve as a playground for my own integration training efforts.  I just thought that
as I work through the details, others might find my up-to-date samples of approaches others
have taken in the past to be useful refreshers for those original code samples and training
guides.  I certainly don't take credit for the bulk of the algorithms and approaches in my
prototypes - they all leverage example code and documentation and help tips from the
internet at large.  When I run across a new source, I try to comment on the URL in the code,
but that is as far as any credits to original thought go.
<p>
<H3>Architectural Prototypes Implemented So Far</H3>
<p>
<H4>org.msscf.sts4training.config</H3>
<p>
This rather simple prototype deals with integrating Spring Boot applications with configuration
property files that can be overridden at the command line in the usual Java CLI fashion.
<p>
<H4>org.msscf.sts4training.javafx</H4>
<p>
This challenging-to-write prototype integrates JavaFX 14 with OpenJDK 14 and Spring Boot
using the code provided by Mario Jauvin as the starting point.  More details are on the
sub-page <A Target="Content" HRef="org.msscf.sts4training.javafx.html">org.msscf.sts4training.javafx.html</A>.
<p>
<H3>Architectural Prototypes Planned</H3>
<p>
<H4>org.msscf.sts4training.jpahb</H4>
<p>
I need an in-memory repository for the client's runtime knowledge base and GEL engine,
and for the in-memory runtime application model instance that is formed from persistent
repository data in the backend.  The first step, though, is to create a variation of
the MssCFKb schema, renaming it the GelKb schema and making use of modern coding techniques
instead of my manufactured RAM layers as produced by the old MSS Code Factory project.
<p>
<H4>org.msscf.sts4training.jpapgsql</H4>
<p>
I need persistent PostgreSQL instances for the application models in the client's
hosted service VM for MssCFe that stores their models under their own internal
security requirements instead of imposing any of my own requirements on the
repository server provisioning.
<p>
This project starts with the basics.  A simple model of the top-level network
definition objects that contain business application schema models.  I won't
dive into a full-depth model for MssCFe; my goal is simply to exercise
inheritance, subclassing, and hopefully some form of polymorphic virtual
interfaces.  We shall see what I can achieve when I pull out all the stops
and memories of how to use JPA from old Hibernate syntax with JEE and JBoss/Oracle
on a project well over a decade ago.  I'd played with some early JPA modelling
exercises earlier this year; I have a head start on this.
<p>
<H4>org.msscf.sts4training.restmysql</H4>
<p>
This variant on a persistent repository using MySQL will be defined to
the point of providing JSON REST service endpoints for a knowledge base
cartrdige download service to a Spring Boot CLI client that just tries
to a few cartridges from the repository.
<p>
Note that this will NOT be a modifiable database instance as far as the
REST endpoints go; it is a read-only database that needs to be re-implemented
using the same database schema/model, but with PHP/MySQL providing the
JSON REST endpoint services so I can host it on a cheap web hosting
provider instead of a full Java-stack hosting provider.
<p>
<H4>org.msscf.sts4training.insecure</H4>
<p>
This project will try to pull together pieces of the
org.msscf.sts4training.jpahb runtime image repository,
a PostgreSQL network model repository from
org.msscf.sts4training.jpapgsql, and a knowledge
base connection via REST to an instance of
the org.msscf.sts4training.restmysql prototype.
<p>
A GUI to tie together all the components in a simple
hierarchical CRUD/Finder/Components fashion will be built
on top of the set of JPA repositories, with the goal of having
the variant on jpahb populated by knowedge base cartridges
retrieved from restmysql server, and accessing a JSON REST
set of endpoints for the jpapgsql repository rather than
embedding the SQL code in the client.
<p>
<H4>org.msscf.sts4training.secured</H4>
<p>
This variant on org.msscf.sts4training.insecure will
add OAuth2 security for accessing the model repository.
<p>
Some variant on security that can be mapped to a
LAMP stack for the mysql repository will be used for
securing read-only access to the data within that
repository.  This will be record-level security,
not table level security as with the models.  I
need to be able to grant clients permission to download
and run only the rule cartridges that they have a paid
subscription for.
<p>
<H4>org.msscf.sts4training.php</H4>
<p>
This will be an attempt to reimplement the secured
JSON REST interface of the MySQL repository using a
LAMP stack.  The goal is for it to be a plug-and-play
replacement for the Spring Boot web service endpoints.
Again, the goal is only to provide a read-only web
interface for downloading knowledge base rule cartridges
the user has a valid subscription for.
<p>
<H3>Down the road: Web UIs</H3>
<p>
That should pretty much cover the architectural prototypes
I'll need to cover the MssCFe, and a rather significant chunk
of the typical bread and butter web stack.
<p>
What I'll have to tackle after that is a <i>React</i> web
interface as that is the most common in-demand user interface
technology the job market asks for.
