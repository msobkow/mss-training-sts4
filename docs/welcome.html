<H2>Welcome to Mark Stephen Sobkow's Training for Spring Tool Suite 4 (mss-training-sts4)!</H2>
<p>
All of Mark Stephen Sobkow's Open and Shared Source projects have their
web presence hosted under <A Target="_blank" HREf="https://msscf.org/">https://msscf.org/</A> 
subdomains, with one subdomain per project.  All of the git repositories for
same are hosted at <A Target="_blank" HRef="https://github.com/msobkow">https://github.com/msobkow</A>
at this time, though as I move forward with incorporation, I will set up a corporate
git account and transfer ownership of the Training for Spring Tool Suite 4 to that corporate
entity.
<p>
This project comprises a family of implemented and planned architectural prototypes to flesh
out the implementation details of the various layers I need for my plans for the MssCFe
application I have in mind for future development.  Most of the architectural layers I'll need
are common to many Spring Boot applications, and I'm already finding a few of my planned
prototypes getting bumped up the priority list to deal with client's needs that are more
pressing than my own.
<p>
The main project pom for this family of prototypes contains a number of sub-module
prototypes.  Each sub-project package deals with a new architecural layer that needs
to be prototyped so I know how to tie the pieces together in real world applications.
<p>
Note that the intent of this project is NOT to provide training to other internet users,
but to serve as a playground for my own integration training efforts.  I just thought that
as I work through the details, others might find my up-to-date samples of approaches others
have taken in the past to be useful refreshers for those original code samples and training
guides.  I certainly don't take credit for the bulk of the algorithms and approaches in my
prototypes - they all leverage example code and documentation and help tips from the
internet at large.  When I run across a new source, I try to comment on the URL in the code,
but that is as far as any credits to original thought go.
<p>
There is a separate page on the <A Target="Content" HRef="msscfe-architectural-notes.html"
>MssCFe Architectural Notes</A> which describes the architecture I'm tryhing to prototype.
Where there is disagreement between that document and this document as to the prototype
modules and their development order and this document, the MssCFe document takes precedence.
<p>
<H3>Architectural Prototypes Implemented So Far</H3>
<p>
<H4>org.msscf.sts4training.config</H3>
<p>
This rather simple prototype deals with integrating Spring Boot applications with configuration
property files that can be overridden at the command line in the usual Java CLI fashion.
<p>
<H4>org.msscf.sts4training.javafx</H4>
<p>
This challenging-to-write prototype integrates JavaFX 14 with OpenJDK 14 and Spring Boot
using the code provided by Mario Jauvin as the starting point.  More details are on the
sub-page <A Target="Content" HRef="org.msscf.sts4training.javafx.html">org.msscf.sts4training.javafx</A>.
<p>
<H3>Architectural Prototypes In Progress</H3>
<p>
<H4org.msscf.sts4training.webdocsrv</H4>
<p>
The Web Document Service will provide read-only access for downloading
a client installation's subscribed documents in order to be able
to do things like manufacture code.  This service is intended to be
generic; it just stores text BLOBs that specify a MIME type defining
their text content type.  All text BLOBs must be valid in the UTF-8
character set.  Details are on the sub-page
<A Target="Content" HRef="org.msscf.sts4training.webdocsrv.html">org.msscf.sts4training.webdocsrv</A>.
<p>
<H3>Architectural Prototypes Planned For Near Future Due To Coinciding Client Needs</H3>
<p>
<H4>org.msscf.sts4training.cfbmr</H4>
<p>
The Code Forge Business Model Repository is the back-end data store for the models in a model repository
server, which is intended to be deployed as a canned VM instance to subscribing clients.  Details are on the
sub-page <A Target="Content" HRef="org.msscf.sts4training.cfbmr.html">org.msscf.sts4training.cfbmr</A>.
<p>
All other MssCFe prototypes will be deferred until I have a corporation set up to own the work
instead of me owning it personally.
<p>
<H3>Down the road: Web UIs</H3>
<p>
That should pretty much cover the architectural prototypes
I'll need to cover the MssCFe, and a rather significant chunk
of the typical bread and butter web stack.
<p>
What I'll have to tackle after that is a <i>React</i> web
interface as that is the most common in-demand user interface
technology the job market asks for.
