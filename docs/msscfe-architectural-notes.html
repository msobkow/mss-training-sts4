<H2>Mark Stephen Sobkow's Training for Spring Tool Suite 4: MssCFe Architectural Model Notes</H2>
<p>
MssCFe will comprise a family of servers and clients in a certain arrangement of nodes and layers
for deployment.  My key restriction is that the Knowledge Base Cartridge Distribution Service has
to be a very simple read-only PHP affair with a MySQL database instance I can use SSH-remoting to
populate from within my network, leaving the data to be downloaded by the tool subscription
clients.  I just don't have the money to float dedicated hosts running full Java stacks.
<p>
<H3>Logical Architectural Layering</H3>
<p>
<H4>org.msscf.sts4training.cfbmr</H4>
<p>
I have selected PostgreSQL as my database-of-choice for my Business
Model Repepositories, but for the sake of training and prototyping I will
only be using an H2 in-memory instance for simplicity's sake.  This will
look a lot like a future CFRtm object hierarchy, which is no wonder as
CFRtm is a virtualization layer that consolidates multiple Business Model
Repositories and Schema References into a cohesive whole for the currently
modeled application.
<p>
CFBmr will be bread-and-butter JPA for now, nothing fancy, but full-featured
and exercising as many features of JPA as I think I'll need in the real
world - inheritance, object hierarchies, parent and container relationships,
children and component relationships, lookup relationships, and named lookups.
<p>
<H4>org.msscf.sts4training.cfrtm</H4>
<p>
This layer defines a Run Time Model in terms of an in-memory JPA
repository.  Behind the CFRtm will be any number of CFBmr instances, each
with one or more referenced schemas imported by the current model in
memory.  CFRtm is a virtualization layer that consolidates all of the
referenced CFBmr's into a single virtual service image.
<p>
The CFRtm instances will only reside in the client runtimes for MssCFe for
now, but I'll probably need them on the server side and in other applications
as well for synchronizing models and model subscriptions across business model
respositories that get published to the internet or intranet as applicable.
<p>
There will eventually be a WebUI implementation that incoroporates a CFRtm
instance for sure, as it will be a web variant on what I'm going to be
creating with JavaFX first.  I think a desktop application is far more
suitable for the workloads I envision MssCFe provisioning than aweb service
would be.  It takes far longer to download manufactured code zips than it
does to manufacture the code locally.  It saves on precious network
bandwidth, too.
<p>
I've decided to use basic Hibernate instances as they only carry a 2MB
footprint at the client on top of the compiled JPA object models and
actual run-time storage used.  I can't imagine a leaner way of providing
JPA logical stores in a memory-caching client suitable for real-world
environments. 
<p>
<H4>org.msscf.sts4training.webdocsrv</H4>
<p>
The Web Document Service provides read-only access for downloading
a client installation's subscribed documents in order to be able
to do things like manufacture code.  This service is intended to be
generic; it just stores text BLOBs that specify a MIME type defining
their text content type.  All text BLOBs must be valid in the UTF-8
character set.
<p>
The service neither knows nor cares whether the documents are
properly identified or formed; they're just text BLOBs to it.
The documents could be XSDs, XML, Open Document types, or Microsoft
Office document contents as long as they don't embed any binary data.
<p>
Documents can be identified and grouped by distribution tags, and an
individual user's account can be assigned one or more distribution subscription
tags that reference the distribution tags.  I want to be as flexible
as possible about how subscriptions are defined and managed, allowing
for the possibility that there may be mulitiple distribution tags which
authorize a client to access a particular document.
<p>
There is no provisioning for uploading documents.  This is purely a document
distribution service.
<p>
Note that it will NOT be using OAuth2 authentication unless I can figure out a
way of doing so from PHP.  Although this initial version is being developed in Java,
I need a LAMP stack version to deploy to my web hosting service.
<p>
Because JPA underpins the model of the service, the clients which deploy a modelling
server will also run these subscription document services for their knowledge base
rule cartridge documents (Well-formed JSON streams), but it will be populated by copies
of those documents loaded from the subscription provisioning servers (owned and
operated by my future corporation.)  The knowledge base document server instance
will specifically restrict the type of documents it stores to knowledge base rule
cartridge JSON documents, but you could deploy other service instances and use the JPA
accessors to manipulate the contents of your document store, or to write a document
upload interface (I might do that some day anyhow, and just leave it disabled for
the deployment server on my web hosting services because it would be far too much work
to recode in PHP for a LAMP stack.  The upload capabilities would only be provided by
a <i>Java</i>-based implementation of the service.)
<p>
<H4>org.msscf.sts4training.kbjpa</H4>
<p>
The Knowledge Base JPA model gets implemented as a runtime Hibernate
instance for now, which exists in the client application.  Partnering
with that will be a persistent PostgreSQL instance used by the
client's server to host their set of subscribed rule cartridges.
<p>
<H4>org.msscf.sts4training.kbcartsrv</H4>
<p>
The Knowledge Base Cartridge server is a specifcally configured instance of a
distribution document server for provisioning the client with knowledge base
rule cartridges.
<p>
<H4>org.msscf.sts4training.kbloader</H4>
<p>
The Knowledge Base Loader is responsible for downloading subscribed rule cartridges
from the kbcartsrv instance and using them to pupulate the client's kbjpa hibernate
instance.
<p>
Once the load process is complete, the client kbjpa instance "locks" the current
rule set as being the manufacturing image to run with and will not modify
those instances again until the application is reinitialized with an empty
kbjpa instance to be loaded.
<p>
The kbloader will NOT cache the cartridges in any other fashion, especially
writing their contents to disk or storing them in a persistent database instance.
<p>
<H4>org.msscf.sts4training.msscfeinsecure</H4>
<p>
The prototype insecure ties together all of the prototype components to date
into a coherent whole with a crude GUI riding on top.
<p>
<h4>org.msscf.sts4training.msscfeclient</H4>
<p>
The "full Monty" client adds OAuth2 security for the model repository services,
with subsequent login authorization querying from the model server as to what
credentials should be used by this particular client to download rule cartridges
from the knowledge base document server.  At no point are the credentials ever
stored in the client itself - they must log in to a service in order to download
cartridges, either by explicitly entering credentials or by auto-pulling them
from their model server after performing OAuth2 authentication.
<p>
The OAuth 2 security will NOT be used by the document servers unless I can do so
easily from PHP in a LAMP stack on my particular web hosting provider (GreenGeeks.com
Canadian hosting services, operating out of hydro-dam rich Montreal.)
<p>
Unless I provision OAuth2 services somewhere on the internet, which likely costs
some significant coin, I won't be able to implement OAuth 2 security for my initial
PHP LAMP stack deployment.
