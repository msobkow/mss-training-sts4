<H2>About Mark Stephen Sobkow</H2>
<p>
If you're considering hiring me for some contract work, you're more likely
interested in my LinkedIn profile at <A Target="_blank"

I won't be dealing with my professional life here, but my
personal experiences with programming and my love thereof.
<p>
I've been programming since 1972 when I was 14 years old, starting
at the relatively local Radio Shack here in Yorkton, tying up their
TRS-80 Model I Level I for hours at a time until I was finally told
to buy one or give up programming.
<p>
It wasn't until 2-3 years later that I started doing real programming
at the University of Saskatchewan as a student in their Bachelor of Science
in Computer Science Advanced program (4 year degree, not 3, allowing for
an extra year which I chose to use to focus on tools and concepts like
compiler theory, linear algebra, set theory, graphics, and databases.)
I've never taken more than a 3-month break from coding since 1982.
<p>
My first C++ manual was the second or third edition, back when it was
a pre-processor spitting out C code.  Operations like dynamic_cast
didn't even exist yet, and STL wasn't yet a glimmer in anyone's eyes.
<p>
I have a long history with and love of Unix-based systems on the backend,
beginning with BSD Unix 2.0, and genuine AT&T SVR4.  I even used SCO on
a 80286, and Minix at home on one as well! I dabbled in Windows
and cross platform GUI toolkits, but I've always had a fondness for
the *nix server platform with its early open source support, and
nowadays I use JavaFX/11 for providing portable GUIs and application
services.
<p>
My very first "big" computer in the fall of 1982 was the terminal room for
the first year students, a PDP-11 with green screen terminals (VT100's and
workalikes) that we only used for editing our source code, shipping it to a
provincial government mainframe to build and run the code. Debuggers? Hah!
We used debug statements and printouts.  That still proves very useful for
debugging active servers in production.
<p>
Currently I provide remote software contract development services
specializing in Spring Tool Suite 4 and Ubuntu 20.04 C++/g++2a development.
At this time, I am provided those services on a direct contract basis,
but I'm taking steps towards incorporation in Saskatchewan, Canada in 2021Q1.
