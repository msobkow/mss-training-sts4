<H2>About Mark Stephen Sobkow</H2>
<p>
I've been programming since 1972 when I was 14 years old, starting
at the relatively local Radio Shack here in Yorkton, tying up their
TRS-80 Model I Level I for hours at a time until I was finally told
to buy one or give up programming.
<p>
It wasn't until 2-3 years later that I started doing real programming
at the University of Saskatchewan as a student in their Bachelor of Science
in Computer Science Advanced program (4 year degree, not 3, allowing for
an extra year which I chose to use to focus on tools and concepts like
compiler theory, linear algebra, set theory, graphics, and databases.)
I've never taken more than a 3-month break from coding since 1982.
<p>
I have a long history with and love of Unix-based systems on the backend,
beginning with BSD Unix 2.0, and genuine AT&T SVR4.  I even used SCO on
a 80286, and Minix at home on one as well! I dabbled in Windows
and cross platform GUI toolkits, but I've always had a fondness for
the *nix server platform with its early open source support, and
nowadays I use JavaFX/11 for providing portable GUIs and application
services.
<p>
My very first "big" computer in the fall of 1982 was the terminal room for
the first year students, a PDP-11 with green screen terminals (VT100's and
workalikes) that we only used for editing our source code, shipping it to a
provincial government mainframe to build and run the code. Debuggers? Hah!
We used debug statements and printouts.  That still proves very useful for
debugging active servers in production.
<p>
Over the years, I've worked as both a consultant and as an employee, and
found that consulting gave me much more freedom to live my personal life,
which is necessary when you're single and don't have anyone else to do
any of the daytime duties that life requires be attended to.
<p>
I am based in Saskatchewan, Canada, officially known as "Land of the
Living Skies."
<p>
I have worked with a wide variety of languages, frameworks, and just about
every commercial or open source relational database on the market.  I take
a data model driven approach to my applications, and have learned to love
the small-team effectiveness of the Agile methodology and the Spring
Tool Suite 4 Eclipse Edition framework.
<p>
I am relatively new to Spring 4, but not to Java nor JEE, having cut my
teeth with Java JDK 1.6-1.8 based JEE as implemented by JBoss/Hibernate
with an Oracle database cluster back in the mid 2000's.  But the new
technology automates such an incredible amount of the plumbing code that
we used to have to write that I am finding Spring 4 to be an absolute
productivity dream at this point.
