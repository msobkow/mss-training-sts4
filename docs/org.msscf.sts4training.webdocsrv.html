<H2>Mark Stephen Sobkow's Training for Spring Tool Suite 4: org.msscf.sts4training.webdocsrv</H2>
<p>
The Web Document Service will provide read-only access for downloading
a client installation's subscribed documents in order to be able
to do things like manufacture code.  This service is intended to be
generic; it just stores text BLOBs that specify a MIME type defining
their text content type.  All text BLOBs must be valid in the UTF-8
character set.
<p>
The service neither knows nor cares whether the documents are
properly identified or formed; they're just text BLOBs to it.
The documents could be XSDs, XML, Open Document types, or Microsoft
Office document contents as long as they don't embed any binary data.
<p>
Documents can be identified and grouped by distribution tags, and an
individual user's account can be assigned one or more distribution subscription
tags that reference the distribution tags.  I want to be as flexible
as possible about how subscriptions are defined and managed, allowing
for the possibility that there may be mulitiple distribution tags which
authorize a client to access a particular document.
<p>
There is no provisioning for uploading documents.  This is purely a document
distribution service.
<p>
Note that it will NOT be using OAuth2 authentication unless I can figure out a
way of doing so from PHP.  Although this initial version is being developed in Java,
I need a LAMP stack version to deploy to my web hosting service.
<p>
Because JPA underpins the model of the service, the clients which deploy a modelling
server will also run these subscription document services for their knowledge base
rule cartridge documents (Well-formed JSON streams), but it will be populated by copies
of those documents loaded from the subscription provisioning servers (owned and
operated by my future corporation.)  The knowledge base document server instance
will specifically restrict the type of documents it stores to knowledge base rule
cartridge JSON documents, but you could deploy other service instances and use the JPA
accessors to manipulate the contents of your document store, or to write a document
upload interface (I might do that some day anyhow, and just leave it disabled for
the deployment server on my web hosting services because it would be far too much work
to recode in PHP for a LAMP stack.  The upload capabilities would only be provided by
a <i>Java</i>-based implementation of the service.)
